  3. Open the terminal and run the command "foreman start".
  4. Run API using any API client like httpie or curl.
  5. Check the list of APIs(http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs) generated by Quart Schema.
  6. Accesing a user's list of games or a game resource requires a HTTP-basic-auth header to be set. 
## Functionalities achieved: 
  1. Authentication of user / Login.
  2. Creation of Game.
  3. Displaying the state of Game.
  4. Displaying the number of guesses left for the user.
  5. Listing the games that user has in the progress.

## Additional Notes:
We were down a member so some nice to haves are missing such as:
- Better documentation on how to use the API
- Scripts to populate the database with test data
- Overall tesing for edge cases
- Clean code
